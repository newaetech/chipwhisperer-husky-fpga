# ChipWhisperer-Husky
This repository contains the FPGA design and test files for
ChipWhisperer-Husky.

# Implementation
Husky uses a Xilinx XC7A35 FPGA; Husky Plus uses an XC7A100.  Implementation is
done with Vivado 2020.2.

When opening the [project](fpga/vivado/cwhusky.xpr), Vivado will report some
"errors" about missing IP that are not actually errors and can be safely
ignored (these relate to ILA modules used in development which are not
included in the repository, because they're not used in the production
bitfile).

Implementation should run cleanly (no setup or hold timing violations) but
timing is tight and small timing failures can occur if you're unlucky. The
usual culprits are:
* `ADC_clk_fb` clock: in `fifo_top_husky.v` for logic around counting
  samples and segments, or writing data from the fast FIFO to the slow FIFO,
  or related to the SAD module. Since the SAD module is so large, timing
  here can be eased by reducing its size (see below).
* `oberver_clk` clock: logic in the TraceWhisperer UART receiver, or in
  `reg_la.v`. These can be given a pass (or you can reduce the
  `observer_clk` frequency).
* `clk_usb` clock
* setup and/or hold violations on the `ADC_DP` inputs.

Violations on these clocks came and went during development. Since Vivado is
deterministic (e.g. if you re-run implementation without any changes, you'll
get the same violations), the best way to get rid of timing violations is to
change the synthesis and/or implementation strategies and try again.

There should be no violations on inter-clock paths. Husky's [implementation
constraints](fpga/vivado/cwhusky.xdc) makes liberal use of `set_clock_groups
-asynchronous` exceptions, and so great care must be taken when dealing with
logic which uses multiple clocks (of which there are *many!*).

Occasionally, a bitfile can be obtained where  FPGA register reads/writes
are unreliable (i.e. [`test_husky.py`'s](#on-target-testing) `test_reg_rw()`
test will fail), which makes the bitfile useless. Again, the solution is to
re-compile with a different synthesis or implementation strategy. If this
occurs, connecting to the scope object usually returns this error message:
"Failed to update the MMCM secondary divider(...)". This message is a
symptom, not a cause -- it occurs because read/writes are not working
correctly.  (The root cause of this issue is likely incorrect constraints on
the SAM3U/FPGA interface; this is hard to correct because Husky uses the
SAM3U SMC interface out-of-spec to squeeze as much throughput out of it as
possible in streaming mode.)

The only critical warnings in the implementation log file should relate to
inconsequential missing IP modules (e.g. ILAs) and the the last three
`dbg_hub` commands.

The SAD module is by far the largest. If you are short on LUTs, or if timing
closure is proving difficult, you can reduce its size by adjusting its
`pREF_SAMPLES` and/or `pSAD_COUNTER_WIDTH` instantiation parameters. The
only (known) limitation is that `pREF_SAMPLES` must be even. Conversely if
you wish to increase these parameters, be aware that the resulting size
increase will make timing closure more difficult; it can also drive up power
consumption to the point where the current draw might be too great at higher
clock frequencies (this would typically result in `scope.XADC` VCC alarms
and/or Husky dying and requiring a hard power cycle).

# Testing

CW-Husky is tested in two ways:
1. Verilog simulation
2. On-target testing

## Verilog Simulation

### Requirements
* [Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com)
* [gtkwave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net)
* **no commercial tools!**

While it should be possible to simulate using Vivado, the current setup uses
iverilog and gtkwave. Try it, you'll like it!

### Running Simulations
Testcases are defined in the `regress.py` script. Run `regress.py --list` to
lists available testcases. 

To run a particular testcase: `regress.py --test <testcase>`. 

Add the `--variant plus` argument to simulate the Husky Plus variant.

Many things are randomized when a testcase is run. To re-run a testcase with
the same randomizations, specify a `--seed <integer>`. 

Add `--dump` to generate a simulation waveform.

To run the full test suite: `regress.py --runs <number of runs>`. This
launches all simulations in parallel, so start with a smaller number to
avoid making your computer totally unresponsive for a few minutes.

Use `--tests` to regress a subset of the regression suite. For example,
`regress.py --tests glitches --runs 10` will run only the testcases which
contain "glitches" in their name.

For simulations, all of the Vivado IP (MMCMs, XADC, clock and I/O
primitives) is bypassed with the exception of the FIFOs. This is done with
`` `ifndef __ICARUS__`` in the Verilog source. This means that simulations
can't fully cover all scenarios, especially with regards to different clock
rates and their interactions. Different clock rates are covered extensively
by [on-target testing](#on-target-testing).

Simulation models for the Xilinx FIFOs are provided
[here](fpga/sim/vivado/), however these can sometimes be problematic as they
are quite finicky about how resets should be applied. The testbench applies
the reset in a way that should satisfy the Xilinx FIFO requirements but yet
somehow the FIFOs can sometimes misbehave (X's propagate, status flag remain
unvalid). 

For this reason, we developed [our own FIFOs](fpga/fpga-common/hdl). Their
behaviour is **not** idential to the Xilinx FIFOs; in particular status flag
latency is different (they also do not suffer from reset bugs ðŸ¤£), and while
they are fully functional and *can* be used for implementation, they are (a)
not guaranteed to be bug-free and (b) fare worse on timing closure. However,
in addition to not being picky about resets, they simulate *much* faster.
So, the Xilinx FIFOs are still used in implementation and remain the default
in simulation; to use the faster FIFOs in simulation, add `--fast_fifo_sim`
to `regress.py`.


### TraceWhisperer
Husky's Verilog testbench does not cover trace. For this, run the
TraceWhisperer testbench in its
[submodule](https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer-husky-fpga/tree/main/fpga).
Verification of trace within Husky is covered by on-target testing (see
below).


## On-Target Testing
Some things can't be verified in simulation; they must be verified on the
FPGA itself.
[`test_husky.py`](https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer/blob/develop/tests/test_husky.py)
runs a comprehensive series of tests automatically. Invoke it like this:
`pytest test_husky.py`.

Many of the tests can run without a target attached; others require a target
running simpleserial firmware. In particular, the trace tests require a
specific firmware to succeed; the target should be programmed with the
firmware included in `hardware/victims/firmware/simpleserial-trace/`.

Among the things covered by `test_husky.py`:
* whether reading/writing the FPGA works reliably;
* whether data from the ADC is sampled correctly by the FPGA;
* whether the advertised streaming rates can be achieved;
* whether the generated glitches have the expected shape;
* whether triggering from trace works correctly;
* whether different clock rates works correctly.

# Debugging

Simulation is always best, but sometimes bugs don't show up in simulation
because the simulation environment isn't a perfect reconstruction of
reality.

To hunt down bugs on the FPGA, you can either:
* route signals of interest to the front 20-pin header and use an external
  logic analyzer (`scope.userio` already has a few options for this, and can
  be extended to add additional signals);
* use the internal `scope.LA` logic analyzer (again, several groups of
  internal signals are already routed to it, and more can be added);
* use Xilinx ILAs.

ILAs require BRAM, and Husky uses 48 of the 50 available BRAMs for storage
of ADC samples, trace samples, and `scope.LA` samples (on Husky Plus there
is a little bit more BRAM left to play with). To free up more, you can
rebuild Husky with `TINYFIFO` defined: this reduces the size of the sample,
trace, and logic analyzer FIFOs. Just be aware that you won't be able to do
long captures. 

If your issue involves streaming, things are a bit more complicated, since
streaming requires deep storage to function properly (the SAM3U reads in
bursts of 64K samples when streaming). You'll have to get creative. One
option is to build without the trace and logic analyzer, by removing the
corresponding defines in `setup.v`.
